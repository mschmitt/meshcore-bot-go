# meshcore-bot

A configurable bot framework for [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore) mesh networks, built with the pure Go [meshcore-go](https://github.com/meshcore-go/meshcore-go) library.

## Features

- **Trigger-based architecture**: Respond to group messages, private channel messages, or on a cron schedule.
- **Go template responses**: Access mesh data like sender, hops, path hashes, SNR, RSSI, and more.
- **Three kinds of radio**: MeshCore KISS firmware over USB or TCP, [openHop Modem](https://github.com/openhop-dev) firmware over USB or TCP, or a bare SX1262 hat on a Raspberry Pi's SPI bus. The same modems [OwlShack](https://github.com/meshcore-go/OwlShack) supports, publishing the same MQTT schema.
- **Private channel support**: Join private channels using a hex-encoded PSK.
- **MQTT integration**: Publish observed mesh traffic to MQTT brokers (e.g. [LetsMesh](https://letsmesh.net), [CoreScope](https://github.com/Kpa-clawbot/CoreScope)).
- **Hot-reload**: Reload configuration via `SIGHUP` without restarting. Reconnects the modem if connection settings change.
- **Radio reconnect**: If the radio is unplugged, its link drops, or it stops answering, the bot reconnects on its own and keeps retrying until the radio is back.
- **Multi-bot support**: Run multiple bots within a single instance.
- **Flexible configuration**: Supports TOML, YAML, and JSON formats.

## Installation

### Download a Release Binary (Recommended)

Pre-built binaries are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows on the [Releases](https://github.com/meshcore-go/meshcore-bot/releases) page.

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/meshcore-go/meshcore-bot/releases/latest).
2. Download the binary for your platform (e.g. `meshcore-bot-linux-arm64` for a Raspberry Pi).
3. Make it executable and move it to a folder of your choosing:

```bash
chmod +x meshcore-bot-linux-arm64
sudo mv meshcore-bot-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/meshcore-bot
```

### Docker

Images are published to `ghcr.io/meshcore-go/meshcore-bot` for the following platforms:
`linux/386`, `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v6`, `linux/arm/v7`, `linux/arm64/v8`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/riscv64`, `linux/s390x`.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/meshcore-go/meshcore-bot:latest
```

### Build from Source

Requires Go 1.26.1+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meshcore-go/meshcore-bot.git
cd meshcore-bot
go build -o meshcore-bot
```

## Running

The bot looks for `config.toml`, `config.yaml`, `config.yml`, or `config.json` in the current directory.

### Step 1: Plug in your radio

Connect your MeshCore radio to your computer via USB. On Linux it usually shows up as `/dev/ttyACM0`. On macOS it's something like `/dev/cu.usbmodem*`.

On Linux, your user needs permission to access serial devices. Add yourself to the `dialout` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

Log out and back in (or reboot) for the change to take effect.

### Step 2: Create a config file

Create a file called `config.toml` in the same folder as the binary. Here's a minimal example that responds to "ping" on the `#testing` channel:

```toml
connection = "serial:///dev/ttyACM0"

freq = 917.375
bw = 62.50
sf = 7
cr = 8
tx = 2

[[bot]]
name = "My Bot"

[[bot.trigger]]
type = "channel"
template = "Pong! Hello {{.Sender}}"
channels = ["#testing"]
match = ["(?i)^ping"]
```

### Step 3: Run it

```bash
./meshcore-bot
```

That's it. The bot will connect to your radio, join the `#testing` channel, and reply "Pong! Hello \<sender\>" whenever someone sends a message starting with "ping".

### Using Docker

Mount your config file and pass through the serial device:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --device /dev/ttyACM0 \
  -v ./config.toml:/data/config.toml \
  ghcr.io/meshcore-go/meshcore-bot
```

For TCP connections (e.g. a serial-to-TCP bridge to the KISS device), no `--device` is needed:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v ./config.toml:/data/config.toml \
  ghcr.io/meshcore-go/meshcore-bot
```

Pass CLI flags directly:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --device /dev/ttyACM0 \
  -v ./my-config.toml:/my-config.toml \
  ghcr.io/meshcore-go/meshcore-bot \
  meshcore-bot -c /my-config.toml -vvv
```

## Configuration Reference

### Connection

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `connection` | Which radio, chosen by scheme. See [Radios](#radios) below. | `serial:///dev/ttyACM0` |
| `baudRate` | Serial baud rate for KISS. Ignored for openHop, whose firmware is fixed at 921600. | `115200` |
| `spiBoard` | The SPI hat, by name. Required for `spi://`. | |
| `modemToken` | Password for an openHop modem over TCP. Kept out of `connection` so it is not logged with it. | |
| `nodeType` | Ignored. Kept so older configs still load; the `connection` scheme picks the radio. | |
| `logLevel` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `trace` (overridden by `-v` flags) | `info` |

### Radio Settings

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `freq` | Frequency in MHz | `917.375` |
| `bw` | Bandwidth in kHz | `62.50` |
| `sf` | Spreading Factor | `7` |
| `cr` | Coding Rate | `8` |
| `tx` | TX Power | `2` |
| `dutyCycle` | Transmit duty cycle as a percentage, greater than `0` and up to `100`. Named after the firmware's `set dutycycle`, but fractions are allowed: `0.1` is valid, which firmware's own knob rejects. Check your region's limit: EU868 sub-bands are capped at `1` or `0.1`, while NZ/AU 915-928 MHz has no duty-cycle limit. Applies process-wide (one radio mux serves every bot and the observer). | `50` |

### Radios

The `connection` scheme picks the radio:

| Connection | Radio |
|---|---|
| `serial:///dev/ttyACM0`, `tcp://host:port` | MeshCore KISS modem firmware |
| `openhop:///dev/ttyUSB0`, `openhop://host:port` | openHop Modem firmware. Over TCP, set `modemToken` if the modem has one. The driver reconnects on its own if the link drops. |
| `spi://` | A bare SX1262 on this host's SPI bus, with no firmware in front of it: the bot is the radio stack. Needs `spiBoard`. |

**SPI hats.** The pins come from a named preset, because a wrong pin gives a radio that is silently dead rather than one that errors. `spi://` on its own uses the board's own SPI device; `spi://SPI0.1` or `spi:///dev/spidev0.1` overrides it, with a warning if it disagrees with the board. `tx` is checked against the module's rating and refused above it rather than clamped. Boards marked `community` log a warning at startup: their pin maps come from other projects and have not been run on the hat here.

| `spiBoard` | Hat | Max TX | Pins |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bq-station-g3` | BQ Voyage Station G3 | 19 dBm | community |
| `meshadv` | MeshAdv | 22 dBm | community |
| `nebra-duo-hat` | NebraDuo-E22P-1W | 18 dBm | community |
| `nebrahat` | NebraHat-2W | 8 dBm | community |
| `pimesh-1w-v1` | PiMesh-1W (V1) | 18 dBm | community |
| `pimesh-1w-v2` | PiMesh-1W (V2) | 18 dBm | community |
| `rak6421-13300x-slot1` | RAK6421 with RAK1330x, IO slot 1 | 22 dBm | hardware |
| `rak6421-13300x-slot2` | RAK6421 with RAK1330x, IO slot 2 | 22 dBm | hardware |
| `uconsole-aio-v2` | uConsole LoRa Module aio v2 | 22 dBm | community |
| `ultrapeaterzero-e22` | Zindello UltraPeaterZero (E22, 1 W) | 22 dBm | hardware |
| `ultrapeaterzero-e22p` | Zindello UltraPeaterZero (E22P, 1 W) | 22 dBm | hardware |
| `waveshare` | Waveshare LoRa HAT | 22 dBm | community |
| `zebra` | ZebraHat-1W | 18 dBm | community |
| `zebra-duo-hat-r0` | ZebraHatDuo-R0-1W | 18 dBm | community |
| `zebra-duo-hat-r1` | ZebraHatDuo-R1-1W | 18 dBm | community |

To add a hat, or correct a pin map without waiting for a release, put a `boards.json` in the working directory. Entries are merged over the presets by name and re-read on `SIGHUP`. The format is the one in [modem_boards.json](modem_boards.json).

On Raspberry Pi OS, enable SPI (`sudo raspi-config`, Interface Options) and add your user to the `spi` and `gpio` groups. SPI has not been tested under Docker; run the binary on the Pi directly.

```toml
connection = "spi://"
spiBoard = "rak6421-13300x-slot1"
```

### Triggers

Each bot has a `name` and an array of `triggers`. Every trigger has a `type` and a `template`.

#### Channels

The `channels` field accepts either plain channel names (for public/hashtag channels) or objects with a `privateKey` for private channels:

```toml
# Public channels — just use the name
channels = ["#general", "#testing"]

# Private channels — use the [[bot.trigger.channels]] syntax
[[bot.trigger.channels]]
name = "Secret Ops"
privateKey = "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6"

# Mix of Private channels — use the [[bot.trigger.channels]] syntax
[[bot.trigger.channels]]
name = "Secret Ops"
privateKey = "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6"

[[bot.trigger.channels]]
name = "#general"

[[bot.trigger.channels]]
name = "#testing"
```

#### Channel Trigger (`type = "channel"`)

Fires when a message is received on a channel that matches one of the `match` patterns.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `channels` | Channels to listen on |
| `match` | Array of [Go regular expressions](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax) to match against incoming messages |
| `template` | Go text/template for the response |
| `retryTimeout` | Seconds to wait for a repeater echo before retrying | `5` |
| `maxRetries` | Total sends, counting the first: `3` sends once and resends up to twice | `3` |
| `charLimitBehaviour` | What to do when a message exceeds the character limit: `"truncate"` or `"split"` | — |
| `pathHashSize` | Path hash size: `0` = copy sender's setting, `1`/`2`/`3` = bytes per hash | `1` |

#### Cron Trigger (`type = "cron"`)

Fires on a schedule.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `schedule` | Cron expression (e.g. `"*/5 * * * *"`) |
| `channels` | Channels to send the message to |
| `template` | Go text/template for the message |
| `retryTimeout` | Seconds to wait for a repeater echo before retrying | `5` |
| `maxRetries` | Total sends, counting the first: `3` sends once and resends up to twice | `3` |
| `charLimitBehaviour` | What to do when a message exceeds the character limit: `"truncate"` or `"split"` | — |
| `pathHashSize` | Path hash size: `0` = copy sender's setting, `1`/`2`/`3` = bytes per hash | `1` |

After sending a message, the bot listens for the message to be repeated back by a repeater. If no echo is heard within `retryTimeout` seconds, the message is sent again, until it has been sent `maxRetries` times in all. This applies to both channel and cron triggers.

### Template Variables

**Channel Trigger:**
- `{{.Sender}}` — Sender's node name
- `{{.Channel}}` — Channel name
- `{{.Message}}` — Original message text
- `{{.Match}}` — Map of named regex capture groups
- `{{.Timestamp}}` — Message timestamp
- `{{.Localtime}}` — Local timestamp
- `{{.SNR}}` — Signal-to-Noise Ratio
- `{{.RSSI}}` — Received Signal Strength Indicator
- `{{.Hops}}` — Number of hops
- `{{.PathHashes}}` — Raw path hashes
- `{{.PathHashSize}}` — Size of path hashes

**Cron Trigger:**
- `{{.Time}}` — Current time
- `{{.Schedule}}` — The cron schedule string

**Built-in Functions:**
- `formatPathBytes` — Formats raw path hashes into a readable string.
- `formatTime` — Formats epoch time from `.Timestamp` and `.Localtime` to local `HH:MM:SS`

## MQTT Integration

meshcore-bot can publish observed mesh traffic to MQTT brokers. This is used by services like [LetsMesh](https://letsmesh.net) to aggregate mesh network data.

MQTT lives under exactly one bot: define an optional `[bot.mqtt]` section on a single `[[bot]]`. At most one bot in the whole config may have it. A unique identity key file is used for authentication.

Configs from before this change (root-level `[[observer]]` blocks) are migrated automatically on first load: observers merge into the first bot's `[bot.mqtt]`, and the original file is backed up alongside as `config.toml.bak-<timestamp>` (the rewrite loses comments). A config with both formats fails loudly instead of guessing.

```toml
[[bot]]
name = "AKL Bot"

[bot.mqtt]
name = "AKL Observer"
iataCode = "AKL"
keyFile = "mqtt_identity.key"
statusInterval = 300

[bot.mqtt.advert]
enabled = true
interval = 86400
lat = -36.8485
lon = 174.7633

[[bot.mqtt.broker]]
name = "US West (LetsMesh v1)"
enabled = true
transport = "wss"
host = "mqtt-us-v1.letsmesh.net"
port = 443
topicPrefix = "meshcore"
retainStatus = false
tlsEnabled = true
authType = "token"
audience = "mqtt-us-v1.letsmesh.net"

[[bot.mqtt.broker]]
name = "Europe (LetsMesh v1)"
enabled = true
transport = "wss"
host = "mqtt-eu-v1.letsmesh.net"
port = 443
topicPrefix = "meshcore"
retainStatus = false
tlsEnabled = true
authType = "token"
audience = "mqtt-eu-v1.letsmesh.net"

[[bot.mqtt.broker]]
name = "CoreScope NZ"
enabled = true
transport = "wss"
host = "meshcore-mqtt-1.baird.io"
port = 443
topicPrefix = "meshcore"
retainStatus = false
tlsEnabled = true
authType = "token"
audience = "meshcore-mqtt-1.baird.io"
```

| MQTT Field | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `name` | Display name for this observer |
| `iataCode` | Location identifier (e.g. airport code) |
| `keyFile` | Path to the identity key file (created automatically if missing) |
| `statusInterval` | Seconds between status publishes (default: 300) |
| `owner` | Owner name included in MQTT token claims (optional) |
| `email` | Email included in MQTT token claims (optional) |

| Broker Field | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `name` | Display name for this broker |
| `enabled` | Enable/disable this broker |
| `dedup` | Enable per-broker packet deduplication (default: `false`) |
| `transport` | `"wss"` (WebSocket Secure) or `"tcp"` |
| `host` | Broker hostname |
| `port` | Broker port |
| `path` | WebSocket path (default: none) |
| `topicPrefix` | MQTT topic prefix |
| `disallowedPacketTypes` | Packet types to exclude (e.g. `["ack", "advert"]`) |
| `retainStatus` | Retain status messages on the broker |
| `tlsEnabled` | Enable TLS |
| `tlsInsecure` | Skip TLS certificate verification |
| `authType` | `"token"`, `"basic"`, or `"none"` |
| `username` | Username for basic auth |
| `password` | Password for basic auth |
| `audience` | Token audience (for token auth) |

| Advert Field | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Enable periodic advert broadcasting |
| `interval` | Seconds between adverts (default: `86400` / once per day) |
| `lat` | Latitude in decimal degrees (optional) |
| `lon` | Longitude in decimal degrees (optional) |

When enabled, the observer broadcasts a signed chat-node advert over the mesh on startup and then repeats at the configured interval. This allows the node to appear in the mesh network as a visible participant. If `lat` and `lon` are provided, the advert includes location data.

## Hot Reload

Send a `SIGHUP` signal to the process to reload the configuration without restarting:

```bash
kill -SIGHUP $(pgrep meshcore-bot)
```

If the connection settings, radio parameters, `spiBoard` or `modemToken` change, the bot reconnects the radio.

## Radio Reconnect

The bot reconnects the radio on its own, and restarts its bots and MQTT observer when the radio is back:

- **The link drops**, such as a KISS modem unplugged, a TCP connection lost, or an SPI radio that stops receiving. It reacts straight away.
- **The radio stops answering** while its port stays open, as wedged firmware can. The bot checks every 30 seconds and reconnects after 3 checks go unanswered, so about 90 seconds.

While the radio is down, the bot retries after 1 second, then waits twice as long each time, up to 30 seconds between tries. MQTT shows the node as `offline` until the radio is back. If the fix is a config change, such as a different port, send `SIGHUP` and it is used at once rather than at the next retry.

openHop Modems reconnect a dropped link inside their own driver, so for them only the answering check applies. If the radio can't be reached when the bot first starts, it exits with an error instead.
